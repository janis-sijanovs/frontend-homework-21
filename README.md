# Frontend Homework 20

I have finished my twenty first homework.

This is my laziest homework so far.
Didn't have time, didn't sleep. Did everything fast.
The Redux works, which is the important part.
Bonus task is done too.
I did not care about styling whatsoever.
File upload doesn't work, 
as I don't know how to explain them to Typescript, 
but instead of spending countless hours
looking for solutions, maybe even learning some had habits, 
I'll just listen to what the teacher will say in class.
